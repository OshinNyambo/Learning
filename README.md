This project simulated the possibility for peer-to-peer knowledge sharing among smallholder dairy farmers
the code was written based on DSL developed for coding models on the Multi-Agent Research and Simulation (MARS) framework
To run the simulation, the dotnet framework on windows was used. 
Data sets to simulate the model can be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/devothanyambo/smallholder-dairy-farm-dataset
